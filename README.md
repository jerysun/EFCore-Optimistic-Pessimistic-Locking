# EFCore-Optimistic-Pessimistic-Locking

Data integrity and consistency along with locking mechanisms, when multiple users attempt to modify the same resource simultaneously, potentially causing conflicts and overwriting each otherâ€™s data.

In this project, we use Entity Framework Core as an abstraction over our data access and Testcontainers NuGet package to programmatically create an SQL Server database container.

## Prerequisites

Testcontainers requires Docker to be installed and running, as it will run a local database container.
